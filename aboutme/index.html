<h2>Conner Lacey</h2>
<p>My name is Conner Lacey. I am from Idaho Falls. I am currently a senior with a major in Data Science. 
    Right now I currently enjoy golfing and driving my car in local autocross events. In the winter months I usually ski.
    I like all sports especially watching the Denver Broncos in the NFL. I hope to eventually do data analaysis for sports. I am excited for this course and to learn more about web design.
